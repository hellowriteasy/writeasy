    "content": "My entire bloodline has heritage from the countryside. It's been like this for a long time, three hundred years at least. Father and mother decided to settle down on this farm—Hay Farm. With beautiful sunshine in the summer, nice healthy sheep with fresh wool to sell, tamed horses with the kindest of hearts, chickens that don't stop laying eggs, and a stream with enough water to last a lifetime. Never before had a farm been so luscious in products, and never before had we been so lucky. Then I was born, and, well, I had different plans... As a small child, I would aimlessly amble around the fields, the grass up to my shoulders, and the crawlies randomly jumping on me from all directions. It actually never bothered me. What made me run home petrified were the horses and the sheep, all affectionately nudging me with their noses; only I thought they were mercilessly pushing me around the place. One day, a man dressed in a smart suit, freshly shaved, with his golden hair combed back, came to our house. I was about six at the time. He said I needed an education as I had come of age, and so he made my parents sign a contract for me to go to some place in a city. I didn't know what that was. I had spent my entire childhood in the countryside. But when I entered the city, I could not believe my own eyes. I was surrounded by buildings piercing the sky, with all sorts of people rushing around some huge grey block, with dozens of cars—though not rusty and old like my dad's—zooming past into the abyss every second. It was a massacre. As my dad led me to school, I was nearly trampled by the amount of people. Once again frightened for my life, I clung to my father's wrist, knowing if I let go, I would be lost forever. I started off despising the place of school, never got a good education at the start. Though I was curious about the streets of the city, nearly attracted. As I began to do my studies in my subjects, I started enjoying taking the bus to the city, enjoyed making friends, and enjoyed every bit of life in the huge urban area. It was as if the countryside was left in the past. Something kept telling me that the city was my home, the one place where I belonged. After college, I moved on to live in the city, no matter how many times my parents wanted me to stay in the farm life the ones before me did, I would not hear of it. My home lay before me. I spent nearly my whole life in the place, traveled across the world, had a wife and kids, and things couldn't have been greater. I was the first one in my entire bloodline to accept change, to accept that sometimes people have to move on, to accept, at least, to change the future for us all..."

    "content": "Once upon a time, there was a cloudy yet sunny rural countryside day, where a majestic and clear river called River Stour flew across. Beside the river was a small forest with indescribable beauty, there were magnificent, breathless and myriad bluebell flowers. Next to the fragrant forest was a building that was too big to be a hut, but too small to be a apartment, so let me call it a house... An unsophisticated house. I saw a brown little labrador retriever walking along the edge of the river pensively as I thought of my grandmother. A sense of sadness and looniness attacked my heart, therefore, I quickly turned my head around and saw a field full of golden daffodils, which is the bliss of solitude that filled my heart with pleasure. The waves of the river beside the stars of the milky way danced as they stretched in never ending line.   But within 30 second, I switched my focus to a fisherman as he tiredly slept in his simple, wrecked but 'full of hope' ship..."

Usually at the start of a day one gets out of bed, and has a nice, filling breakfast. That wasn't the case for the fisherman. The only way for him to quench his emptiness was to use the river's resources. The fisherman exited his humble abode and stepped outside. That early morning smell of nature got to him, and so the fisherman took a deep breath in through his nostrils. As many times he stepped out of his house, he would never get used to the aroma. Great oak trees greeted the fisherman like an old friend, its branches outstretched eagerly for a hug. In front of the fisherman was a field he liked to call 'Sheep's haven,' as the white, fluffy balls of wool rested on the endless green grass. The chirps of nearby birds could be heard. Their soothing, gentle voices as one.\n\nThen there was the fisherman's most prized possession, the thing he could not live without: his beloved river. The steady flow of water trickled and gently splashed around his feet; not cold, but a cool, friendly to the skin temperature. See, the river was right next to his front door, and the only way the fisherman could enter and exit his home was to wade through or use his tiny rowing boat. The fisherman positioned himself in a bush by the bank of the river, his wooden spear at the ready. Now it was a waiting game.\n\nAs he had done countless times before, he triumphantly waded back home with a fish on the end of his spear. Breakfast."

The clouds surrounded it blocking some of the light that came down. A dog with brown and white patches on it lapped the water. It then looked at the water, staring at it. A wagon was deserted in the water and two men were next to it talking and one touching a metal wagon. The metal wagon was rusted and brown. It was as if the two men were trying to find something in the water. \n\n  The dog looked at the two men. It was like it was lonely and needed something or someone to play with. There was a fisherman hiding in the bushes so he won’t alarm the fish. A person came out of the house and crossed the river to see the fluffy white sheep. The house outside looked deserted and abandoned. It had moss all over it and ivy creeping up the walls. The river and the house did not go together. One was beautiful the other was ugly.  \n\n The trees looked stunning. They towered over the house making a little curve as they went up. It looked like a cave for the house. The sun cast a shadow over the forgotten house. The trees in the distance looked small but some of them still huge. Th river twisted and turned in the distance. The clouds grew more in number and covered the sunshine but a little bit of it shone through and created a shimmer of light. The trees casted a shadow over most of the river near the house. There was a small bit of wood under the bushes that the fisherman was sitting on."

The gentle dance of the breeze as it would caress your face, fleeting, gone within mere seconds? The first rays of sunlight in the morning that would stroke your hair with playful fingers, soothing and warm? The mischievous bite of the cold that nips at your exposed skin in a lively game of chase? Suddenly, life does not seem so dull and repetitive but teeming with opportunities that are yours to take. I certainly have, and yet I am too late, my fingers greedily grasping at the last strands of the possibilities that were not mine to take. I loved life with all of my heart, and I did not realise it until it was snatched from me, leaving me bereft. I loved it, and yet it is now so far away.\n Would you care to hear how I have gotten myself into this cruelly ironic position? How I reached for the last ashes of my life and humanity before they were quickly seized from between my wanting fingers? How I now lie, cold and devoid of all that I was foolish enough to love, alone and empty at the bottom of all darkness? Perhaps you would not. Maybe for the best. And yet I cannot help but force it upon you, force and force and force my suffering and lament onto you until you are bloated with my tears and cries.\n  I hate it here. How funny that I lie for eternity in a place that I do not belong? Me, the bringer of sadness and sorrows, in the creek where children play their little games, flushed and giggling, where mother ducks bring their little ducklings, all looking eagerly for morsels of bread that they will surely never find, where the jolly little man picks his berries, hoping to make a pie later. They all pass, blissfully unaware of the pitiful sorrows that lay beneath their feet. All I can do is watch and occasionally reach my hand out, almost as if to grab them, hoping their happiness will diffuse to me as well.n\n It has not worked yet. \n And the horses. Fantastic beasts, fine and elegant. It is almost a shame that their owner cannot recognise such beauty. Well, I could hope so. What can a dead man do about the living? They pass almost every day, disturbing the waters so that they slosh around and disturb my bones. They now lie in a bed of silt, unknown and unloved by anyone ever again. Not that I was loved in my all-too-brief lifetimes anyway. They, the horses obviously, as there is nothing to say about myself, as unremarkable of a human I was, used to be so proud and tall, on a high podium that almost nothing could push them off of. Notice how I said 'almost'. That would be a little knack that we humans have, grinding down and pulverising perfectly good things in order to show our dominance. And yet now they pass, having fallen to the hard, cold ground, and they know, they have experienced, what it is to be owned by a human. The little prance in their walk is gone, as is the lustre of their coat, the spark in their eye, and the proud hold of their head that defines them. As well as almost everything else that makes them unique."

I stepped inside to find that there was a  secret laboratory with potions and things that I have never seen before. Now I know why he kept me away from here; because he was a scientist the whole time and he has been covering this up!\nBut what astonished me the most was that there was a peculiar circle behind everything which had nothing in the middle surrounded with a lot of electric equipment. I  felt something under my feet and it was a red button. When I looked up, there was a beam of light that shot out and blinded me.

Horses trot through the water, their rough, coarse manes scraping against the water, which was pushing right back against them. The worn wooden cart creaks as it rolls through the water, streaking it. Water rippling as the horses stride across the shallow pond. Trees guard the exit of the pond, casting a long shadow across the ground as though painting it. Mud squelches with each gallop, the cart rocks steadily as it travels down the dirt path.\n The farmer sighs as he stares into the distance, a tired empty look in his eyes, as he has given up all his hope. He arrives home, opening the front door and sits by the bedside, where a pale, sickly looking child lies. The farmer glances at his daughter, her sickly complexion saddening him even more. He goes to the backyard and stares at a roughly carved gravestone. Silent tears drop from his face as he mutters some words under his breath and decides to head to the nearby village to buy some bread. He gets on the back of his cart and they head off. Tall, gnarled trees like hands spurt from the ground, the long skeletal branches seem to be taunting him. The rhythm of the galloping steady and strong. The farmer looks up, only to see a man wearing a cloak, standing in front of his cart. He yells at the man to move before he hits him, but to his astonishment the man seemed to phase through the horses and the cart.\n He turns to check on the man, stopping and hopping off his cart. The farmer approaches the man to check if he was hurt or not, as he looked at the mans face, he could not see a face, there was just a vaguely human face that seemed to shift constantly. He felt as though there was something stuck in his throat. He could feel his vision dimming and his senses dulling, the man then whispered in his ear, I can help you, but it will come at a price."

    "content": "By the time we reached the fork in the river, the clouds had began to gather together as if they were attending some party. The only gaps of light were slowly disappearing, and a noticeable chill began to settle. Passing a fisherman concealed in the bushes, I waved at him, and received a nod in return. Behind him, sheep grazed in the lush, open fields without a care in the world. “I say,” said Alex, suddenly pointing at a house on the other side, “Doesn’t that look like a nice place to stay tonight?” Me and Alex had journeyed down the river, after the roads had been blocked off by soldiers and tanks. Barricades had been setup, and the only way we could reach our parents in North Dakota was by following the river downstream. So, with all our belongings in the world; two horses by the names of Betty and Dixon, and a wooden cart filled with all we had in the world, we urged our horses down the bank and into the river. It was a shallow one, and much calmer compared to further downstream, but both Betty and Dixon struggled trotting, so what would have been a ten-day journey now would take perhaps thrice as long.\nAs we trundled along, occasionally getting sprayed by the odd splash from the horses’ hooves, I took a glance at the house Alex had pointed out. It was nestled amongst towering, yet dying oak trees; a testament to the houses age. The white coating on the houses walls was peeling, and aged and mossy brick walls were beginning to show. Compared to the blackening clouds above, the house stood out, as if it was offering refuge. A few whisps of smoke lazily lingered around the chimney, reminding me of the cozy fire at my parents house I could be sat in front of, had we travelled a little faster. The idea of staying the night in this house of rustic beauty grew more appealing with each passing second, and when the distant booms of thunder could be heard, I knew we should at least see if they were willing to take us in. Alex nodding in agreement, 'Can’t be worse than sleeping out in the open.'\nI shook the reins, and guided the horses towards the house, their hooves splashing in the shallow water. Once we were dry land again, I called out, “Hi! Anyone home?” A moment later, the door creaked open, and there stood a middle-aged woman with a worn and flour covered apron, yet the most sympathetic eyes I had ever seen. She looked at us with a mix of curiosity and concern. “Good gracious! Did your horses decide to go swimming?' she said, as water dripped from both the horses and cart. 'Actually, we’re trying to get to North Dakota, but the roads were blocked by soldiers. We were wondering if we might stay here for the night,'' I said, trying to sound as polite as possible. After a pause, she nodded. “Come on in, then. It’s more dangerous than you’d expect these days: you’ll be arrested for trespassing if you get found sleeping in the open. You can tie your horses up in the stable. We have stew on the stove, if you’re hungry.'\nRelief flooded me as I heard her kind words. After securing Betty and Dixon, we entered the house. The interior was as warm and inviting as I’d hoped, and there was the fire with a great pot hanging over it, crackling and filling the room with the smell of cooking. The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Becket, and setup a small room where we could sleep. Over supper, we learned that Mrs Becket’s husband and two sons were away, helping neighbours fortify their homes against potential threats. Despite being alone, she seemed well-prepared and capable of looking after the house. As we sipped on our stew, we shared our story, to which she lent her ear. 'You’ll be safe here for the night,” she assured us. 'I’ll see you get back on your way tomorrow.'\nAs I drifted off to sleep, I felt we had arrived in a place of peace and safety, where one can find solace and comfort. The sound of the always flowing river and the cackling fire created a soothing lullaby in which I soon forgot about the challenges ahead, instead feeling as carefree as the sheep in the field.\nI awoke to a clear sky, although the air still held a tingling chill. After a full morning spread, we thanked Mrs. Becket heartily, and mounted our horses feeling content. Mrs. Becket handed us a basket full of the finest country food, and untied the ropes. 'Safe travels, my dears,' she said. “Take care of each other, and may God be with you both.' \nThe river which stretched out before us seemed less intimidating, thanks to the kindness of a stranger. The road to New Dakota was long and fraught with challenges, but together, we were ready to face whatever lay ahead."

The man's tired eyes fixated on the structure, his mind contemplating the risks and potential refuge it might offer. With a hoarse voice, he muttered, 'Though it appears dilapidated, it may provide us a sanctuary. Let us go in.' With cautious steps, the man carefully made his way across the threshold, navigating through the remnants of a once-lived-in cottage.\nTo his left, a disarray of broken furniture lay strewn about, like an unwanted toy . Its shattered pieces created a chaotic tapestry of abandonment. Yet, to his right, an mystery awaited—an alluring door made of polished oak, adorned with intricately carved designs. The man's curiosity sparked,  a flurry of questions danced through his weary mind. 'What secrets lie behind this door?' he pondered. Against his better judgment he felt drawn to that irresistible pull towards the unknown.\n  Attracted by a mixture of desperation and intrigue, he yielded to his curiosity and gingerly turned the door's handle. With a creak, it swung open, revealing a sight that left him momentarily breathless. Just as he marvelled at the breathtaking scene before him, a powerful force seized the man, pulling him into the very painting that mirrored his surroundings. In an instant, he and his cart became eternally ensnared within 'The Haywain,' and are still forever locked behind its bars, trapped within the captivating artwork. "

A cool breeze swept the air, causing ripples in the water, and ruffling up the cotton clouds. Flecks of crepuscular light slipped through the verdant leaves, well fed on a diet of rich sunlight. In the distance, on a meadow of yellow flowers and trimmed grass, grazed a small group of sheep, off to take shade under the trees.\n\nNearer to the cottage, a man was sat in an old hay wain, his son looking off it, which bumped along the shallow, pebbly river bed.

It was Iyllitian made, beautifully crafted with golden curves alongst it's sides, but Kip was too busy being choked to admire its beauty. The acrid smell of black powder and sweat hung in the air but no one dared to cough, in the hopes of not being discovered, no luck. Soon, Kip and his gang were tied up in a circle with Office Grandle on one side and Sergeant Darkstar on the other. The bag of nyxio and opia lay spilled on the ground, being blown away in a sudden gust of wind. Every grain blown away was 200 dalts being wasted. Kip cursed under his breath and stared at the bag. Something cracked against his cheek and a rough hand lifted his face. 'My, what a load, 20000 dalts worth of drugs being transported by five petty little merchants, you were practically begging to be caught. By Andow's beard you'll certainly get heavily fined if not bolted by the Council.', sneered Darkstar, 'In fact, just because you runts didn't but up a fight today, I won't send you to the Mind Thresher.'

But then everything went wrong, just as Kip guided the wagon through a small creek, a puppy ran out of a cottage straight towards them, Kip cursed and tried to turn the wagon, but it got caught and tipped over.

It was such a refreshing smell, one that distracted my mind of all the troubles lurking within the fog, the unseen creatures of the dark, and the worst of them all: the flood. It was a horrible flood, sinking the grass and the animals and the plants. Too much rain becomes unbearable – but, somehow, the rain also soothes me and calms me from itself.  I couldn’t bear to step outside, because of the disgusting texture of the brown smudge that covered almost all of the ground. The Earth felt like it could swallow me in one bite, enveloping me inside a prison of wet and suffocating dirt. The skies above were almost the same color as the ground below – a threatening, darkish color waiting to strike and take you away. I looked out the window slowly, and saw the trees swaying from side to side, branches moving by their sides like a promenade in the rain. My aunt stood by my window scornfully watching the stains on her blue skirt, and her carriage in the water. She was soaked to the bone – her dress torn from the crash and her blouse with mud. The only glorious thing still standing were the horses, the long and lean and glorious horses. Their manes were shiny and adorned with droplets of rain. The two of them, Bailey and Ken, seemed unaffected by the dirty and mushy water pooling around their hooves. They seemed quite happy, in fact. We found them from mother nature – perhaps the rain that we despise so much is like a second mother to them. They neighed and whinied as my aunt splashed water on their noses, holding her skirt and grimacing every step of the way as her blouse got wet. The way such a small thing represents such drastically different things to different people is so strange to me. Perhaps that should be one of the wonders of the world, a fact like little. My aunt, although grim-faced, started talking to the horses in a hushed whisper. For comfort, perhaps. Maybe she thought they were scared – of the rain, maybe. But perhaps they don’t all have to share the same fear. Maybe rain is a guardian to some and a demon to another..you just have to observe."

Rolling gently over the smooth stones, a Haywain pulled by two powerful ponies and a short, stout man slowly crossed the shallow stream. His shirt was messily tucked into his bottoms and the sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. A loose straw-hat sat on his head, bobbing up and down as the cart motioned through the river. The three horses were neatly groomed with pristine saddles that perfectly fitted them. Their body was ink-black and together, they looked exactly alike. Compared to the scruffy farmer, the horses looked extremely out of place as they steadily trotted on. Everything was still and silent. The only sound was the rhythm of the wheels.\n Meanwhile, a curious dog watched, padding along the bank, leaving a set of tiny paw-prints etched in the sand. He was small, thin and had only scraps of leftover food to eat. Drooping like a dead flower, its hazel, floppy ears relaxed and covered his eyes. Curling into a ball, the dog settled on the side and dozed off to the soothing sound of trickling water.\n Standing lonely and proud was an ancient, rustic house that had overlooked the entire lake for hundreds of years. It was there for so long that ivy and moss had completely coated the rooves and walls. The once-white house was now a natural green colour with some flowers newly sprouting up the chimney. Right beside the house were towering trees full of luscious leaves and sweet berries. All the branches were covered with twittering birds.\n Whenever you looked up, you would see a large expanse of snow-white clouds gradually floating away. Even the air tasted so pure and fresh of flora and fauna. Every now and then, there would be an occasional tweet of a bird followed by another until there was a whole symphony of songs. As the man surveyed the beautiful scene in front of him of the lush riverbanks and golden meadows, in his mind was the harmony of humans and nature."

The clouds there are dark and gloomy, bleaching out any happiness from the non-existent sunlight. Gradually, the horses slowed and I stepped out of the hay wain. I then helped my cousin out as well. He had come to visit for the weekend, since his parents had an “appointment”. Tobias assisted me in unsaddling the horses, and we led them back to the stables together. “The storm looks bad, huh,” I cleared my throat, in hopes of starting a conversation. My cousin and I had been close when we were younger, but we’d grown apart. “Yeah,” he hummed in agreement. Silence. ‘Awkward,’ I thought. Sighing, I focused my attention back on the horse I was supposed to be cleaning. Bella nuzzled me gently with her nose, begging me to finish up so she could rest. As I turned my back to Tobias, I let out a defeated sigh.  As we headed back to the house, I gazed out towards the gathering of grey clouds again. Thunder rumbled in the distance, a low growl as if something had angered the sky. As the clouds quickly move in, rain starts pelting down on us. Moving our arms to cover our heads, Tobias and I ran towards the house, stepping in small puddles of rain. At the threshold of my home, I accidentally set foot in a huge puddle of water. Water droplets splashed upwards, dousing me— and Tobias. For a second, we just stood there, staring at each other. This moment was painstakingly like the old times; playing in puddles outside in the rain, going to the pond together in summer, having a picnic by the river in spring. Then, at the exact same time, we both burst into laughter. I wasn’t quite sure what was so humorous about this situation, but I couldn’t stop laughing anyways. And, for the first time in forever, I couldn’t help but pray that there was still hope for Tobias and I to become close again. He had seemed so cold, eager to shut everyone out. Now, looking at the laughing boy in front of me, it seemed like we had never even fallen out. Hesitantly, Tobias smiled at me. “You know, we should probably get back.” I didn’t seem to hear him. I was elated. A smile! He never smiles these days! My heart jumped at the thought of getting my childhood best friend back. “Um, hello? James? We should get back.” He waved his hand in front of my face. I glanced up and saw that he was right. The clouds were hovering directly over us, the rain still mercilessly pelting down. Thunder sounded again, much louder this time. I grinned back at him. “Good idea.”"

This is the story of a farmer called Tom.\nIt started when Tom woke up at dawn to check his livestock and crops. As he was just finishing milking his cows and fetching water from a well, he noticed some particularly nasty clouds on the horizon. He dismissed it casually after a few moments of consideration, returning his attention to the day's work.\n Just as he went inside, the clouds had melted into a hellish black. They suddenly poured out a torrent of water, like a massive bucket that was used at a fair to clean your animals. Tom and his wife were shocked and surprised, as they watched everything loose - their wagon, their livestock, even the crops were washed away in the fierce river. \n After securely boarding up their windows and doors with spare timber, they rationed their food not knowing when the flood would end. A week passed listening to the radio before their supplies went lower and lower.\n Finally, after two weeks the rain receded at least to the river banks. They slowly unboarded the windows and doors and peeked out to see the most beautiful sunrise ever seen. They admired it until the farmer realised they had to dig out their wagon from the banks of the river. they worked until the sun went down, and slept by the light of the moon."

The stray puppy was half russet colored and half grayish it was seemingly curious about these humans as it peeked at them. But these humans took no notice at the canine as they glared out into peaceful lake slightly glancing at the boat attached to it. Beside them in a cramped bush creeped a camouflaged fisherman holding out a fishing rod, hoping to catch a good prey.  \n On the side of this reserved river implanted a medium-sized cottage, as the chimney blew out some white smoke as it flew recklessly overhead. The cottage had slender trees growing out beside it snuggling up beside each other. The cottage seemed a little bit old and dusty due to the unclean walls, windows. Beside this old cottage sat a tiny figure, who seemed to be staring out into the green river. He sat hunched-forwards. Thick, gloomy trees stood aside the cottage as it loomed over the horizon, almost spawning everywhere on the grass field. \n Far away settled a few sheep waddling around without a care in the world, while tasting the fresh, green grass. Some were playing hide and seek around the bushes as they toyed and explored the huge field. They were mostly under a huge tree that sheltered them from the sun, which was also blocked by the marshmallow clouds. The sky was half gloomy with the dull clouds and weather. But , there were still a petite bit of sunshine peeking through the dark clouds wanting to be exposed fully. The only bit of sunlight was exposed to a small pitch of the never ending field. \n The dog was still idling on that same spot on the side of the wide river, cowering aside when the thought of touching the freezing water. The humans still took no notice of this other creature that was afraid of the cold water. In the bushes the same fisher was still in its boat, the bushes shielded him while he was still awaiting a catch on his rope. The old cottage sat there as still as a statue with that same old man sitting hunched- forward staring into the void. The flocks of sheep still joyfully toying around in the slightly wet field."

Their house is nearby as the crumpled little bricks fall off like fine sand. The dog is barking as he thinks there are lots of people that are playing and not inviting him into the fun but really they were just fishing for food. The trees and clouds are all letting their colors out as much as they an and the sun was shining so much that everything in that area was shining and glowing because the sunlight was blazing down onto the floor.    The water was clear and the sky was blue with small sighs of clouds and the blue sky was bearing its most color. The grainy ground was extremely lumpy which made the dog shout for help because of the uncomfortableness. This actively demonstrates that the person who wrote this was very good with detail. Along the lines of any painter, this one was no different than any other since there are all of the similarities from this one and other ones. At the present time the normal artwork is nothing compared to this since it sells for less in the normal world that we have today due to the fact that in those olden times there was no games so there were just loads of people who just practiced painting and, boom, there we go. Clean and surprising not worn down which is very unsurprising since it is probably under glass or something.  A large percentage of painters these days can’t do things like this because most of the people alive also known as men and women do not have the time to do this random stuff since they are just constantly working and getting money for their wives and even children. On the other hand back then the work back then was just straight up easy and everybody had the time to do some random things.\n Coming back to the picture the trees are all waving slighting due to the fact there is probably wind in the picture because they are in the countryside anyway. At the top of the picture there it seems like there will be storm come due to the fact that the clouds are extremely dark gray/grey. The grassland in the distance seemed to be shining bright and is probably the people’s farmland for food and all sort of that crop stuff that farmers use."

    "content": "(narrative writing)\nOnce upon a time, in an old-fashioned village settled in the middle of big and bumpy hills and meandering rivers, there lived a man named Thomas. Thomas was a painter, and his heart sang with the beauty of the world around him. He lived in a cozy cottage at the edge of the village, where every corner seemed to hold a story, and every whisper of the wind carried a melody of its own.\n\nOne bright morning, when the sun painted the sky with hues of gold and the air was filled with the smells of wildflowers, Thomas decided to travel into the wild with his canvas and brushes. He followed the winding path that led to the riverbank, a place of quiet calmness and timeless charm.\n\nAs Thomas reached the riverbank, a scene of beauty unfolded before him. There, under the large, dark, and healthy oak tree, stood a wooden hay cart. Its wooden frame was beaten by the weather from years of use, but it had a simple, old-fashioned charm that reminded everyone of a time when things were easier. The hay cart was weighed down with large amounts of hay, a tribute to the dedication of the farmers who worked tirelessly in the fields.\n\nInspired by the scene in front of him, Thomas set up his easel and began to paint. With each brushstroke, he captured the beauty of the grass and wildlife. The vibrant greens of the meadows, the bright blue of the sky, and the gentle flow of the river. But it was the hay cart that stole the show, standing proudly in the landscape, a symbol of resilience and perseverance.\n\nAs Thomas painted, he lost himself in the rhythm of his brushstrokes, the world around him fading into the background as he poured his heart onto the canvas. The sounds of the chirping birds, the rustle of leaves, and the soft murmuring of the river became his company, guiding his hand as he worked tirelessly to bring his vision to life.\n\nAs hours passed in a blur and the sun began its descent behind the hills, casting a warm glow upon the landscape, Thomas finally finished his last strokes and stepped back to admire his masterpiece. The hay cart, immortalized on the canvas, seemed to breathe with life, its presence bringing timeless beauty to life. With a sense of satisfaction, Thomas packed up his belongings and began the journey back to his cottage. As he walked, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the gift of creativity that allowed him to capture the beauty of his surroundings. Although the sun may set and the seasons may change, Thomas knew that the memory of that perfect day by the riverbank would live on forever in his heart."

The trees rustled, creating ghostly sounds within their leaves, wails of terror and anger escaping the imprisonment of the tree. I could hear the noisy chatter of the people behind me; worry could be heard in their voices. It had been raining hard as I journeyed back towards home, the warm scent of food and burning wood vivid in my memory. The rain had been relentless, pouring down with no mercy. A lake had been created outside of home, one which I was now wading through, the water reaching up to my knees. It was cold and miserable; the load attached to my back seemed to get heavier and heavier, weighing me down by the second. A bark was heard from the shore, and I twisted my head to see Charlie, his intense eyes watching me. I could see longing in his eyes, glancing at the water. He couldn’t swim any longer and was too old for much movement. I breathed a huge sigh and turned around, keeping pace with my sister, who was helping pull the luggage as well. She looked weary and tired, her eyelids drooping. We had traveled all night just to come back to a wet home and a whole lot of trouble.\n\n***\n\n“Oh Sam, when it started raining and flooding, all the lights went out and I didn’t know what to do!” I cried, running into his arms. He patted me on the head, murmuring comforting words. I looked back at our house, wet and miserable, everything inside either washed away by the flood or ruined, our small fortune gone.\n\n“We have no money for food or clothes, and rent is due next Tuesday!” Sam looked worried, lines appearing on his face. The rain kept coming, as if to match the hot salty tears rolling down my face. Charlie barked nearby, watching the horses.\n\n“I’m afraid we might have to sell Charlie, as old as he is,” I said, “and the horses as well.”\n\n“But we’ve had him since he was a little baby!” Sam protested.\n\n“I know, but what can we do? Everything’s gone, and we have no use for an old dog or those horses. And look at them; they’re barely able to pull the luggage, much less work.” Sam looked down at his hands, his posture sinking. I knew it was hard to let go of Charlie, especially since Sam had found him one day in an alleyway, and we had taken care of him since.\n\n***\n\nI watched the clouds move past slowly from my stable, drifting with the wind. I noticed the humans looking towards me a few times, looks of despair and consideration. I didn’t like the way they kept looking back at me. A feeling of dread filled my stomach, and I lay down, too tired to think about anything else. I soon drifted off, the rhythmic breathing of my sister putting me to sleep."

The long towering trees casted a cover over the animals that dwelled in the nature's underbelly. Dark clouds were started to loom over the empty fields, blocking out the sun but further trapping any heat still left in the dense but empty atmosphere. The lonely house seemed to sway in the heat as day wore on. The Sprocker walked up, curious at the couple's doings but walked on finding other interests to do.The slow flowing stream created a fresh pillow as it gently swayed onto the horse's legs. The distant hum of the gentle waves become a lullaby and that was the only sound but in their absence, they found a different kind of beauty in the quietude of the day.

'Oh, will you help me now?' asked Miss Picker, throwing a handful of grain that she had inside her cart. 'Fine, fine!' squeaked out Mr. Orchard. But smirking to himself, he went inside the house and called out over to Fluffy the dog, 'Get me the stickiest glue we have in the house.' said Mr. Orchard with a shiver going down his spine.

Vines crawled onto the house and expanded over time. As the sunlight shines onto the shattered glass, the light reflects the colors of a rainbow, making it look so magical. Outside the house, two farmers were sitting in a carriage, so concentrated in their conversation, while crossing the shallow water to reach their next location. As the breeze passed by, the trees started singing beautifully, and everything just seemed so peaceful. It was a day when the sun came out of the clouds, making everything look delightful. "

Today was city day. Mary and Leilani (nicknamed Lee) were going with their father for the first time ever. They jumped out of bed, pink and blue petticoats tossed on their petite heads in a rush, the silver ribbons deftly tied to the golden ringlets on the twins' heads. Mother had been awake since the bright early morning, since the first wake-up call of the cuckoo, and the delicious smell of toast and butter, jam, and salt pork drifted through the house and out the open window, into the country air and the open doors of cottages nearby.\n\nThe clopping of horses’ hooves sounded sharp and stark through the birdsong morning. The black and brown manes of the Christmas Day mustangs still shone as if they were new, never dented, never soiled, as clean and unreal as the morning the family had set their eyes on them. The watchdog, a handsome beagle named Cooper, bounced around by their feet, tongue lolling out of his mouth, having caught the contagious excitement that was now dominating the twin girls. They ran about the house, squealing and giggling, bubbling to the brim with exhilaration.\n\n“Mary, Lee, sit down!” shouted Mother. “The food is getting cold, and at this rate, we are never going to get to the city.”\n\nGuiltily, the two girls made their way to the table, said their prayers, and feasted on the still-warm toast and the butter that melted in their mouths. They were not to be greedy today; they had been taught to put others’ needs before their own. That was the way. But neither of them could control themselves and secretly made lists with each other of the beautiful hair ribbons and silk dresses they would ask for. As they all patted their mouths clean, they heard Pa call from the outside.\n\n“Ready yet, Emily? The boys have been hitched up now.”\n\n“Coming, Arthur!” responded Mother.\n\nTaking each of the girls’ hands in her own, she strode out of their petite whitewashed cottage and climbed into the carriage. It rocked and swayed precariously as she stepped onto it, causing the horses to widen their eyes and shake their heads. Pa put a hand on each to steady them, and it worked like a charm. He was an animal whisperer, and tales of what he was able to do always spread across the little town like wildfire, reaching the nosy neighbors before they could help it. The twins were little bubbles of excitement as they climbed onto the carriage and tucked their legs in. It was to be a long but beautiful journey, and the sun was still drowsy from a good night’s sleep. But the peaceful family might be in for a sprinkle of mischief.\n\nThe carriage rambled through the woods, creaking and rattling to the beat of the wilderness—the melodies of the birds and the tinkling of the lake. It bumped its way through the trees, their leaves shielding away the sun so that the twins and their Mother could take off the scratchy and vision-blocking sun bonnets to admire the scenery. Mary let out a little sigh of joy. A duck had just gone waddling past with a string of ducklings behind her, tumbling and cartwheeling over each other, doing handstands in the water, and nipping at their siblings. Lee turned her head towards the lake and let out a giggle that echoed through the foliage. As the clock ticked on and the children's eyes drooped, a slow murmur, then a growing wave of voices greeted them. They were finally here! The twins' heads shot up simultaneously, and they looked around in awe at the city people. Pa leapt off the box seat like a coachman and lifted the ladies off, twirling them around as their feet met the ground. There were so many things to explore and creatures to see. Lee tugged at Mother's dress, gazing up at the shoulder of a gentleman dressed in velvet.\n\n'What is it, Mother?' she whispered, eyes wide open.\n\n'It is a monkey, Leilani,' she replied. She turned up her nose at the man disdainfully, 'and it ought to be in the wild.'\n\nLee nodded her head, pretending to agree with her mother, but secretly, she was naughtily thinking of getting her own little monkey.\n\nThe little family walked past stalls and shops full of taffy and dresses and beautiful creatures, but never stopped. It was all too hard to choose which shop to visit, and as they immersed themselves in buying all sorts of clothes, sweets, and accessories, they never noticed a little brown creature climb onto the carriage and grab the reins.\n\nA high-pitched whinny pierced the bubbling city conversations, and all the passers-by turned their heads to see a monkey, no bigger than a child's forearm, clinging onto the reins of two mustangs, leaving clouds of dust in their path. Pa let out a groan of despair and ran like the wind. The shouts and sharp whistles that were futile against the monkey and the horses bounced off the walls of buildings in the deafening silence. A thick curtain of dust and dirt blew up into the air, and men and women were coughing and sneezing, rubbing their eyes blindly, their self-important and haughty noses now pointing straight down at the floor. All of a sudden, a looming silhouette stepped out from the clouds of dust, silent as a shadow, holding the reins of the now tranquil horses in his hand, a brown little monkey perched on his shoulder. Pa reached out and grabbed the horses and carriage from the mysterious figure, fury radiating off of him in visible rays. He turned around like a tornado, but the man had been quicker. All that was left was a piece of black velvet.\n\nThe family was back home. The air smelled fresh, cleaner than the city, but the girls admired their new dresses. There was a place to frolic and play in, but in the city, there was none. The countryside, with its whitewashed cottages and the songbirds' melodies, was home. And though the city was wonderful with all its color and silk and haughty ladies and gentlemen, it was too loud, too busy, and full of thieves and creatures that should have been locked up. And more than anything, the city would never, ever, be home."

The book I now held in the palm of my hand, its magic fully relinquished and dried, the magic that had captivated my mind, my soul. And that is the interminable events that happen within life, life is but a stage and the page after page we turn: one full of sorrow, one full of joy; all equally important yet irrelevant. \n A momentous revelation struck me on the spur of the moment, life itself in the embodiment of humanity is but transient on the world, what lives on is culture. What especially resonated with me in this particular book was perhaps the depiction of a hundred thousand humans marching to the aid of a library in Pathos, against semi-omnipotent beings, knowing that they would not be their match but just so that a few precious books would be given the time to be slipped onto vessels safely away. They were decimated that day and not a tenth of the precious scrolls were spirited away but it intrigued me beyond words to think that such things have happened in the real world, and that was just a portrayal of how purely good humanity can be, but also how evil and filled with cruelty. \nThat is what I thought as I stood on my balcony, watching the yellows and greens of the countryside fly past in hues of yellow and green, that this is what humans were born to be, and the importance of culture, knowledge and above all, goodness in the world."

It is really old, at least as old as my dad, so selling is would give us a huge tonne of money.

From about the age of six years old, when my parents went on a business trip somewhere in Europe, my grandparents were called upon to look after me while they were off working. I loved it when they would come. They'd tell me loads of stories about their childhoods, and even let me play some video games, as my parents never let me, and still don't. On that day, I remember, 12th February,  my grandpa took it upon himself to give me a steel watch with a white face, that you have to shake tremendously so that it doesn't lose time. Each time I shaked it I got irritated.

I guess my Uncle was a clumsy man back in the day, because nowadays he works at a sushi restaurant, and that's when you really cannot be slipping randomly cause then you would cut yourself.

They liked our owner’s room, and they found it nice and comforting. They didn’t want to be escorted to a new place. But we had no idea where we were being taken."

I open my last piece of junior school clothing; the jumper you get given when you leave the school. I held my leavers Hoody like it was the most delicate item I had ever touched. My hand slipped inside my jumper, and I instantly knew that it would be a pleasure to wear, for the inside was extremely soft. There was a large pocket at the front of the jumper, the perfect place to put essential items inside. My eyes traveled upwards, and my favourite colour combinations there - a light rose and a clear white.\n On the back was my name, and in large digits, the number 24, it was the number 24 because 2024 was the year I'd be leaving. The names of all the other girls which were leaving were also inside the digits. I scanned both of the letters to find my name, which was at the very bottom of the integer 4. It seems rather clever that they have done the names in alphabetical order.\n Memories would come back to me whenever the jumper was exposed, like a jar of full them, touching events, stories, and adventures. It links the past and present together, giving me a sense of wholeness. The countless wonderful memories, of the time I had at my junior school, would came dancing back to me. It helps me take what I did well, and what I could improve on, to make each time I try something to a higher standard. As if each time I dive to collect a pearl, each time the number of bad spots on it seems to go down. As well as connecting to the past, I could anticipate that future would also be brighter, strength, passion, and ideas could erupt in me. It was the most precious piece of clothing I have, because it links my childhood journey, with challenges I have navigated through. Along with learning the value of perseverance, courage, and kindness."

So, I ran around the whole house screaming “MUM! MUM! LOOK WHAT’S ON TV!” And when she came in the living room, she promised to buy me one for me and another for my sister.\n   I nagged and asked and begged all day until a Thursday afternoon. I felt truly dejected. I’ve asked her for three days! I thought, did they forget our order? Then when I marched through the door, sighing with every step, when suddenly my sister jumped onto me and shouted, “LOOK, ALAN, IT’S OUR WATER BOTTLES!” I was surprised and was wondering what was happening, until I saw a brown package on the floor, with a blue air-up bottle box inside. I was looking at it for a second, before me and my sister literally shouted the whole house down. My mum said that we were both overreacting, especially me, but I didn’t care. I’VE WAITED SO LONG (four days) FOR THIS BOTTLE, AND I FINALLY HAD IT!\n   With the bottle, I was also surprised by the fact that there were those little round things called flavor pods. At first, I was really confused about what it was, before I realised that it was a thing that you put around the top of your bottle and will have lots of fruity flavours! How cool is that? (very). I got mango passionfruit, whilst my sister got the wild berries. Mine tasted amazing, but to be honest, m sister’s pod is a bit better than mine (I stole another pod from her).  "

The clapper, a great bronze thing, clanged and banged against the iron side day after day, causing chaos and confusion.\n\nThe bell was very ornate, a handcrafted wonder made of the finest metal and carved by the most skilled blacksmith in the land. All the lords and ladies at the palace were drawn to it like moths to a flame.\n\nYet the bell had a personality, rough and rowdy, with a temper that flared and roared with the passing days. Trapped inside was a spirit, one that had once terrorized the kingdoms and struck fear into the hearts of others. However, he became too reckless and was caught and imprisoned with a lifetime sentence.\n\nFor years he rotted away in his cell, his cruel heart crumbling, his hope dying until it had disappeared completely. His spirit, having no source, became trapped in a bell—the one in the palace clocktower.\n\nThis bell would not be staying any longer, however. One day, when the maid was lighting the torches on the walls, she tripped and fell on her face, the fire flying from her hand and onto the grand red carpet. Flames licked at the fabric and ignited, spreading down the corridor and engulfing all it came across. It roared like a wild animal, leaving charred destruction in its wake.\n\nSlowly, the whole floor was ablaze, the flames creeping higher and higher until they finally reached the tallest tower, the bell clanging and banging inside. The spirit screamed as it was melted by the fire, its evil essence vanishing into the afterlife."

It always makes the click sound every second that passes. Its needles always walk like an old man on the street— as slow as a snail. It glows in the dark like a full moon.\n\nAlthough my watch may be cheap and sometimes useless, it still makes satisfying noises when you turn the button and push it in. Its battery could be as cold as an ice cube or as hot as a volcanic rock that just came out of the oven. It could tell us the time, but sometimes the timer isn’t quite correct.\n\nYou could also imagine yourself as a time changer by stopping time or going to the past or the future by using the little button on the top right and turning it. You could also time your own race in a game or maybe even in real life! My watch looks more complex than any other normal watch bought in the stores. The glass on top of the face of the watch is made out of bulletproof glass (I was the one who removed the old glass and installed a new bulletproof one on top of it), so you could nearly do everything with it: throw it hard into a puddle of mud, go zip lining with it, swim with it, shoot it with a gun, or maybe throw it into fire—whatever you do to it, it still looks the same! This watch is extremely different from the original version.\n\nMy watch is very useful in many ways. Firstly, it is useful for looking at the time and setting a time limit for yourself. Then, my watch could be used for entertainment. Lastly, my watch is a part of me; I got it for my birthday, so it is very important to me."

    "content": "Stuffed animals can be of all different kinds and shapes. But for mine, it was different. At least in my heart, it is different from all others. It is a cute whale that can turn into a blanket. The whale is brown at the top of its body, and at the bottom, it’s a kiwi. The whale is about the size of a human's head. It had a smell that reminded me of home and just made me feel comfortable. This smell can be anything but it's just smell and feel the best when it comes out of the washing machine. It feels fresh and also clean. I had this stuffed animal since I was young for pretty much all of my life. It holds lots of memories inside of it. There are scratches and sewing marks on the stuffed animal that represent these memories. On the top of the whale, you can see the cotton coming out of the stuffed animal because, over time, the original sewing is loose and the cotton will slowly fall out of it. The main reason why the original sewing is loose is because I always like to punch it like a stress ball to relieve the stress I have. Other scratches would be at the bottom of the whale, where it shows the stomach of the whale, which is the kiwi. It had to sew marks all over because of the thin fabric. As I hugged it every night, the fabric went against my clothes, and slowly the fabric on the whale's stomach became thinner and thinner. Leading the inner filling of the whale to come out which is cotton. It reminds me of my childhood, how I would look at the whale every day and talk to it like it was my best friend, though I picked on the whale and accidentally made cotton out of it."

    "content": "I can still remember the day I found it. \nI was reluctantly walking my dog on a gloomy winter’s morning. It was that dim, grey hour when things were just creeping out of the darkness, the bushes still dull, the sky colorless, polluted, and devoid of joy. The hollow trunks of the trees were framed against the weak sun like the bars of a prison, and the sky was as dreary as a thundercloud, grim with the menace of rain. However, just when I thought my day could get any worse, that was when I saw it. \nLying right in front of me was a painting that I had never seen before. It was as if some angel had miraculously come to rescue me from this misery. The pure essence of the painting seemed to not only brighten up my mood but the surrounding atmosphere as well. As if on cue, the sky changed from dull to red, and the sun rose in a glorious explosion of pink and gold. \nAs I gazed at the painting in awe, I saw a picture of Mother Nature taking its stunning course. I could hear the sweet harmony of birds singing. The aroma of fresh air wisped through the place like strands of silk caressing your skin. The light rays of the morning sun lay dappled against the leaves like a blanket of golden yellow. The flowers resembled a carpet of jewels, glistening with the morning dew and vibrant hues. The branches of the trees were painted with autumn’s crisp leaves of green and yellow, gold and red. It was as if nature had painted this place in reds, yellows, and greens and sprinkled tiny diamonds on the flowers to shimmer and dance in the fresh morning sun. \nThe intricate designs embedded within this painting gave the impression that it was unique. When I first saw the painting, I sensed a spark of connection. This was the first time I had ever experienced a ‘connection’ with an object. \nAfter gazing at the masterpiece for what seemed like an eternity, it seemed so real, as if I was actually surrounded by the beauty of nature. That was until I blinked again and took in my actual surroundings. I took a glance around me. The land was barren, and the ground was hard with black frost that seeped through my already sodden boots, spreading ice into every limb. I shivered in disgust. Was the painting how our earth used to look like? I wish it was. It almost seemed as if the painting was mocking our modern world. And although I was clueless about the painting’s past, I did know one thing: we had completely destroyed our planet and stripped Earth of its resources. The painting just portrayed what it could have looked like if we had not polluted our planet so much. However, it did signify that we still had hope. A part of me lit up; it would be anyone’s dream to see our world as a better, greener place. Maybe my dreary walk in the park was not so dull after all!"

    "content": "It’s an Adidas backpack made of blue linen. It has 3 pockets, two big ones and a tiny one, each one of them can be closed by the ZIP fastener. Dwo straps on the back of and handle on the top make it like million backpacks in the world. On the front of it, you can find a big logo of the brand. After so many summers and winters it is finally worn partly, but people seemingly can still recognize the original shape of it. Every time when I see that logo I use to  stand in front of it for a moment and stare at it just like a piece of art. This stuff has its own magic. While looking at it an invisible hand grabs my waist and pulls me back in time. In the scorching July summer a young boy running with a 7 size ball and sweating, tries to do the shooting moves perfectly. He always carries a blue backpack, which seemingly is his best companion during his training. I come back to reality as soon as my mother shouts at me:\n “David! What are you looking at? You are late for school!”    \n Sometimes I like to ignore the noise, becauseI really enjoy the feeling of nostalgia, they seem to be really foreign and familiar at the same time. After these years the backpack stopped to be that normal backpack. It symbolizes time that I had spent as a 10-year-old child. It is so valuable and pure, full of freedom and happiness. The backpack also helps me remember my ambitious childhood’s dream, which seems to be impossible now and sounds so ridiculous in the opinion of a 17 year old boy. It somehow points out that I am already grown up. People have a strong will to invent a time machine and travel in time. But they haven’t realized that they actually own it already after birth. It is called memory. It brings me back to the best moment of my life and of course those worst."

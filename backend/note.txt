for 100 stories there will be 400 api calls to compare each story with other 
and for each api call we send writings for 2 stories with some prompt . 
Average words for each story 800 . 

stories 100
api calls 400
•⁠  ⁠*Tokens per API Call*:
  - Each story has approximately 800 words ≈ 1,000 tokens.
  - Comparing two stories + prompt ≈ 2,300-2,500 tokens per call.

  •⁠  ⁠*Total Tokens*:
  - Estimated 400 API calls × 2,500 tokens ≈ *1,000,000 tokens*.
